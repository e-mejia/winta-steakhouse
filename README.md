# Winta Steakhouse + Grill

PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT: A restaurant landing page.

# How's it made

Tech used: HTML, CSS, React Router, ReactJS

A landing page for a fictional steak restaurant built in React.

The following functional components make up the app:

- Home
- About
- Contacts
- Gallery
- Menu
- Navbar
- News

and the following files are used to style the markup:

- App.css
- About.css
- Contacts.css
- Gallery.css
- Home.css
- Menu.css
- Navbar.css
- News.css

# Optimizations

I want to make the form page access a backend db to store the data. MongoDB most likely.

Lessons Learned:

How to navigate to a new component using react router. Helps to see how the pages all link together as a unit.
